Range

x <- sample(1:6, 1001, replace=TRUE)
range(x)

x<-rnorm(1001)
range(x)

# New Statistic : Variance

You can calculate this on a random variable it will give you a width of the distribution that follows.

Let X be any R.V.
*V*[X] = Σ(x-_E_[X])^2

b + a divided by 2 gives us the expected value.

x <- 1:6
fx <- 1/6
Ex <- sum( x * fx )
sum( (x - Ex) ^ 2 * fx )

Small Challenge : 

Analogy : 

Sample          Population
Sample Mean     : ΣX(n) * 1/n     *E*[X]Σx*f(x)  X in S


Sample Variance : Xn - (Xn * 1/n) ^ 2 * 1/n == Variance

x <- sample(1:6, 1001, replace=TRUE)
var(x)

standard deviation
if mu hat is in meters if Xn is in meters.

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The only thought here is to remove the extra units. It is the most common measure of a width of a distribution.

Sample Standard Deviation and we'll use the function sd()

Last topic before exam one : 

Likelihood Method

An algorithm that tells us how to estimate population parameters with a sample.

meta algorithm : logic : refer to lecture notes on the website likelihood.
