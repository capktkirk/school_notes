Today : Expected Value 
        : Sample mean a second look
        : Physical interpretation
        : Some examples
      : Variance
        : At least definition and quick interp


Announcement : Homework 7 is posted. #1 is at the beginning of class, 

R would generate the probabilities of A1 and A2 as well as the probability of A1 being apart of A2.

Expected Value : Let X be any Random Variable.

To calculate the value E (Bold letter E) 
We're going to add up all the values that X can be, and multiply it by the density function.

E[X] = { x * f(x)
      X in  S

Let X~Uniform(1,6)
Random Sample :  2, 4, 5, 3, 3, 4, 1, 6, 2
  Sample Mean Weird Way : 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 ,5, 6
  Add Like Terms : 1(1/9), 2(2/9), 3(2/9), 4(2/9), 5(1/9), 6(1/9)
  Estimated Density Function Value
  Shorten it { X 
            X in S
  Sum = 30
  
  x < sample(1:6, 1000, replace=TRUE)
  mean(x == 2)
  
  The E[X] code is a fancy way to replicate the Density Function.
  
  Once you get exactly to it you get to the population mean (the expected value)
  
  In R
  
  fhat <- prop.table(table(x))
  ux <- 1:6 //This is the support of X
  ux * fhat 
  sum(ux * fhat)

  Follow along the X axis and find the value that "Balances" out the scale is what the expected value is.

If we want to find the expected value of a fair coin

E[X] = { x * f(x)
      X in {1, ... ,6}
      
     1/(b-a+1)  { from b to x = a,} { x = .... =
     (a + b) / 2
