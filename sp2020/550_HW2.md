1. Build SCC (strongly connected component) graph H for the original graph G. (Kept this one the same way Elena implemented)
2. Run Topological Sort on the SCC graph H. (created a topSortSCC functions that runs on the SCC graph. Used topSort() as guidance)
3. Store the last vertex in the topological order, letâ€™s call it t.
4. Find the transpose of H, call it T. (Created a transposeSCC() function, used Elenas transpose as guidance).
5. Run BFS on T and use t as the source for this BFS. Initialize distance array with INT_MAX.
6. Check distance array if there is any distance[v] equals to INT_MAX, then there is no path from t
to v in T; hence, there is no path from v to t in H, and not every vertex has a path to a sink in G.
In this case, output -1. If there are no INT_MAX values in distance, then find the minimum vertex
of the original graph G in the SCC (strongly connected component) t and print it out.
