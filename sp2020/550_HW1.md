2 <= N <= 100 (nodes)
labeled 0..(N-1)
all edges same weight. No two roads cross, unique path to each node.
shorted "longest" path. (need find_longest)

d(x, v) the distance between X and V
L(x, v) longest distance other than X and V
If you calculate L(x, v) for all nodes. The facility, called u, whose L(u, v) is the shortest, will be the center node.
In case of tie, smallest node wins.

shortest "longest" path.
cin to read input, cout for output.

Line 1 of all input files will be N
All other lines will be edges.


Make Graph
BFS the highest distance node (the end point of the diameter) (create find max)
Run BFS on that highest diameter node, find the highest distance here (end of diameter)
findCore() : divide length of diameter by twice the distance. That's the core.



void Graph::topSort() {
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
		parents[i] = i;
		colors[i] = 'W';
	}	
	int t = 0;
    topOrder.resize(size);
    int index = size - 1;
	for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
		if(colors[i] == 'W'){
			dfsVisitTopSort(i, t, index);
		}//if
	}
}
