Today :
  * Tomorrow a lab, but Roualdes won't be here.
  * Friday a lab, but Roualdes won't be here.
  * Connecting population and density function
  * Plotting estimates of density functions
  * Estimating probability of poker hand.

Sample is the mean of the data in our dataset. Theoretically estimating a population parameter.

Example : 

N <- 10000
p <- 0.75
x <- sample(0:1, N, replace=TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
mean(x)

mean(x == 5) will take the mean of whatever we check against x.

prop.table(table(x)) -> creates an estimated probability that an item in the table occurs.

data.frame(prop.table(table(x))) -> creates a data-frame of the above table.

ggplot(df, aes(x, Freq)) + geom_point() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1))

faces <- c("A", 2:10, "J", "Q", "K")
suits <- c("C", "D", "H", "S")
deck <- expand.grid(faces, suits)


M <- nrow(deck)
N <- 10001
x <- rep(NA, N)
for( N in 1:N) {
  idx <- sample(M, 1)
  hand <- deck[idx, ]
  if(hand[1] == "A" && hand[2] == "S"){
    x[n] <- 1
  }else{
    x[n] <- 0
  }
}


idx <- sample(M, 1)
deck[idx, ]

This will create a new card every time.
