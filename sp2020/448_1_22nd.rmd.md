Quizzes will be "open note" for VIM or whatever. Multiple choice.

Final/Midterm will not. But, it will be a mix of multiple choice and fill in the blank.

After quiz there will be a covering of the data afterwards.

Before midterm and final, there will be a big "Review Quiz" and you can take it as many times as possible.
