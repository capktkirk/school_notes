Refactoring :

Loose coupling is preferable, but high cohesion.

Cohesion : How related everything is in a class. High/Low cohesion.
Coupling : Tight/Loose (the less reliant one class is on another class the looser it is.)

Loose coupling is associated with high cohesion
Tight coupling is associated with low cohesion

Software Maintenance : Maintain loosely coupled classes.

    - Identifies how they are related.
  Weaknesses :
