A directed Acyclic Graphi scaleld a DAG 

Given a DAG G, a list of vertices

Topological  Sort

All edges fo from left to right when vertices are topologically sorted.

Problem : Given a DAG G = (V, E), sort vertices of G using topological sort

Solution : Run DFS on G and as soon as vertex u is assigned its finishing time, insert u in front of a list TS

The list TS has vertices in topological order
? Could you use a vector<int> to store the vertices in topological order.

Stamps[u].l = time;
TS.insert(u);

pushback vector to store vertices in topological order.

BFS,DFS run time is O(V + E)

TS.Insert(u) runs in constant time.


v[i--] = u; and decrement.

#### EXTRA CREDIT

topSort();

You need to write two functions with the following declarations : 

void topSort(); (This function builds sorts vertices topologically
void printTopOrder(); (This function prints topOrder vector in format


##### LECTURE

Definition : In a directed graph G=(V, E), a strongly connected component is a set S of vertices in V such that for any pair of vertices in U, V in S, u is reachable from v and v is reachable from u.

##### Extra Credit 

Give G = (V, E)

Run DFS(G) to sort vertices in decreasing order by finishing time (This is basically topsort, topOrder will have the correct order for this.)

Compute the transpose of G, G^T = (V, E^T) 
Transpose : Transpose of a graph it has the same nodes, but all the edges are reversed directions.


Run DFS(G^T) considering sorted vertices in that order in main loop
//We need a dfsTranspose() function, from topOrder
//if(colors[topOrder[i]] == 'W'){} in uGraph::dfs function fo

A SCC is a set of vertices of a depth-first tree
//When you call it on the 0, that will be in the same connected component.
