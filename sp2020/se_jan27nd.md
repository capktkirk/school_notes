  #Roles :
    *Product Owner* : Key Responsibility : Maintain the product backlog. :
      -> Product Backlog : A detailed to do list. With basic priority.
    *Scrum Master* : Task Master.
    *Daily Scrum* : Daily meeting to update the current status of the "Scrum"
      -> Each person shares three things : What they've done, what they're going to do, any blockers they have.
        *Blockers : Hinderances.*
      -> Each person has a chance to share what they're doing as well, changes they need to make, etc. (High Level)
      -> Only within the software development team.
    *Sprint* :
      Timebox : Upper limit of how long it should take to get something done.
      We will be working within two week sprints : Like so :
        -> Plan Sprint          : (What we are going to do.)
        -> End Sprint           : Review (Demonstrate what has been built to other people.)
                                : Figure out something to add.
        -> Sprint Retrospective : Go through and figure out what the problems were, and what were done to over-come them. What went well, what did not go well. (People, Processes, Tools)
