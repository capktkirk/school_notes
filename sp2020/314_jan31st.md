Bernoulli Distribution : A family of probabilties P, where there's only two outcomes and that P is attached to the outcome labeled "1"

  Requirements : 
    * Two Outcomes (0 and 1)
    * Probability of 1 is p.
    * (Not required, just happens) : label 1 ia success even if it is rather unfortunate.

  (Assume population follows when conditions are met.

  F(xlp) = p^x(1-p)^(1-x) X<{0,1}
  
  F(1lp) = p; F(0lp)=
