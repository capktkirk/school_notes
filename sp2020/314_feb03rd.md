# Bernoulli Distribution : 
Described as a Family of Functions/Family of Patterns that populations could follow.

### Density Functions for the Bernoulli Distributions : 

F(x|p) = p^x(1-p)^1-x

F(0|p) = 1 - p
F(1|p) = p

All functions in statistics have a density function.

Next Distribution : 

# Uniform Distribution : 

Is a pattern you can apply to different populations than the bernoulli distribution.

Example : Dice Rolling : A bunch of different results, but same probabilities of the outcomes.

### Density Function for Uniform Distribution :

F(x|b, a) = 1/(b - a + 1)

### Uniform Distribution with Bernoulli
The roll of the dice. You can take these distributions and create other distributions out of them.
