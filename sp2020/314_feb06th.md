Sampling Distributions and Bootstrapping :

  A sampling distribution is the distribution of a sample statistic.
    * Sampling distribution of X is the distribution of X.
    * A sample statistic is a "mean" of X.

  X ~ N(100, 20) normal distribution
  X(BAR) is the mean(x)
  
  Sample of Things : Avg of Things
  
  We want to know the distribution of X(BAR)

  Shape, Center, Spread :
  * If repeated random samples of a given size n are taken from a population with the population mean mu and the population standard deviation sigma.
  * X(HAT) ~ N(mu, SE)
  * Shape :
    * The sampling distribution will be approximately symmetric and bell-shaped when n is large or the population has a bell-shaped distribution.
    * Bell shaped means "normal distribution"
  * Center : 
    * The sampling distribution will be centered around the population mean mu.
  * Spread : 
    * the spread of the sampling distribution can be measured by the standard deviation of all sample means.
    * This variability is so important that it gets its own name:
      * Standard Error - SE is the standard deviation of the sample statistic. (X(BAR))

  * Bootstrap : 
    * Imagine the "population" is many, many copies of the original sample. Then we can sample repeatedly from this "population"
